You dream of spiders
"Relax," he says to you
"Daddy long legs, also known as harvestmen..."
They're crawling all over him as he speaks
Dozens of them
"...don't harm people. They even keep away..."
but you don't hear the rest. His jaw unhinges like a snake,
his mouth pouring out what has to be hundreds of the long
spindly-legged creatures. His pupils dilate and then his 
eyes roll back in his head as the spiders rush you
You wake up shivering.
