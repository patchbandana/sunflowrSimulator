You dream of loud drums
Why are they so loud?
If they can't play well, they should play quieter
You decide to go to the garage to give them a piece of your mind
But when you get to the door, you hear another sound even louder than the drums
You crane your head to listen closer and a drop of water falls on your nose.
You wake up wet. Is that drool?
