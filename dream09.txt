It's night time in the desert
Two dogs run past you and you smile
"Come here, girl!"
But when you get closer you find them not to be dogs at all
A coyote? A wolf? A jackal?
Your expertise is flowers not wild animals
The hyena on the left bares its fangs at you and snarls
The canine on the right just stares
"Inside of you there are two of us"
You wake up groggy.
